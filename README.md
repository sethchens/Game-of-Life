# Overview
This is a replication of a famous simulation called Conway's Game of Life. This cellular automation provides an insight of how the initial state of cells evolves over time. Each cell simply has two states: live ro dead, 
and is determied by the states of the surrounding 8 cells.

The purpose of this project is to understand how a simulation is achieved with looping, learn about concurrency in C++, and serve as a practice exercise for analyzing whether incorporating concurrency is necessary 
to optimize its performance or functionality

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
